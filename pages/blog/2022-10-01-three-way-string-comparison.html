<h1>No Safe Efficient Ways to Do Three-way String Comparisons in Go</h1>

<p>Three-way string comparison is widely used in programming (<a href="https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+switch+strings.Compare+lang:Go+&amp;patternType=literal">proof 1</a> and <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+strings.Compare+lang:Go&amp;patternType=standard">proof 2</a>).
But up to now (Go 1.19), the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19/src/strings/compare.go#L7-L28">strings.Compare</a> function in the standard library
is (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33353106">intentionally</a>) implemented with <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/3012">a non-opitimized way</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Go">func Compare(a, b string) int {
	// NOTE(rsc): This function does NOT call the runtime cmpstring function,
	// because we do not want to provide any performance justification for
	// using strings.Compare. Basically no one should use strings.Compare.
	// As the comment above says, it is here only for symmetry with package bytes.
	// If performance is important, the compiler should be changed to recognize
	// the pattern so that all code doing three-way comparisons, not just code
	// using strings.Compare, can benefit.
	if a == b {
		return 0
	}
	if a &lt; b {
		return -1
	}
	return +1
}
</code></pre>

<p>When comparing two unequal strings, the implementation will perform two comparison operations.
Whereas a perfect implementation only needs one,
just like the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19/src/bytes/bytes.go#L23-L28">bytes.Compare</a> shown below,
in which <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19/src/internal/bytealg/compare_native.go#L12">bytealg.Compare</a> is implemented using assembly code
on most architectures.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Go">func Compare(a, b []byte) int {
	return bytealg.Compare(a, b)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>strings.Compare</code> implementation is comparatively inefficent.
Specifically, it is less efficent when the two string operands are not equal but their lengths are equal.</p>

<p>Benchmark code constantly shows <code>strings.Compare</code> uses 2x CPU time of <code>bytes.Compare</code>
when comparing unequal same-length byte sequences (we view both strings and byte slices as byte sequences here).</p>

<p>The internal comment for the current <code>strings.Compare</code> implementation
is some interesting. The comment suggests that we should not use
<code>strings.Compare</code> in Go at all, but no alternative efficient ways are available now yet
(ironically, this function is used in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19/src/cmd/go/internal/modindex/read.go#L822">Go toolchain code</a> and recommended by <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19/src/sort/search.go#L88-L99">a standard library function</a>).
It mentions that the compiler should make special optimizations to automatically
convert the code using comparision operators into internal optimized three-way comparisons if possible.
However, such compiler optimizations have never been made,
and there are no plans to make such optimizations yet as far as I know.
Personally, I doubt such optimizations are feasible to be made for any use case.
So I think <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50167">the <code>strings.Compare</code> should be implemented efficiently</a>,
to avoid breaking user expectations.</p>
